Demonstrating using variables, handling different data types, operators and conditional decisions in JavaScript

## What I learned from this practice example:
- How to show variables to the html pages using JavaScript (not just working in the console)

## Fixed Issue:
- The total cost after tax: from hardcoding 30 to multiplying ticketCostDollarsCDN into taxRate 
- Fixed from hardcoding 24 to minimumAgeToPurchase in if-else function
